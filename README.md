## Credit Risk Analysis
This analysis evaluates the performance of various machine learning models in predicting credit risk for lending. By analyzing loan performance data, including features such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan balance, we are attempting to construct a classification model that accurately categorizes the risk associated with lending. The analysis will help investors decide which loans to back or guarantee.

### Summary
The machine learning models used in this analysis demonstrate different performance levels in predicting credit risk. The precision score of 0.80 suggests that when the model predicted a loan as high-risk, it was correct 92% of the time. The recall score of 0.97 indicates that the model was able to identify 97% of the actual high-risk loans.
Based on these results, I would recommend using this model for the company. This model gives a good balance between accuracy and precision, making it a reliable tool for assessing credit risk. If the model's performance were to decline or if it showed a significant bias towards either false positives or false negatives, further investigation and adjustments would be necessary.
